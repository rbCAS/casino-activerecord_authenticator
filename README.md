Provides mechanism to use ActiveRecord as an authenticator for [CASinoCore](https://github.com/rbCAS/CASinoCore).

ActiveRecord supports many SQL databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, ...

To use the ActiveRecord authenticator, configure it in your cas.yml:

    authenticators:
      my_company_sql:
        authenticator: "ActiveRecord"
        options:
          connection:
            adapter: "mysql2"
            host: "localhost"
            username: "casino"
            password: "secret"
            database: "users"
          table: "users"
          username_column: "username"
          password_column: "password"
          pepper: "suffix of the password"            # optional
          extra_attributes:
            email: "email_database_column"
            fullname: "displayname_database_column"
